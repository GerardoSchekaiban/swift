                         Following the fall of the First Order, the New Republic struggles to maintain peace among divided star systems. New alliances are forged... and old enemies resurface.

                         Meanwhile, on the unknown edges of the galaxy, a mysterious signal has been detected. An ancient call, lost for generations, that could alter the balance of the Force forever.

Hoping to find answers, young Jedi Master REY SKYWALKER leads a secret mission into the unknown, unaware that a forgotten shadow has awakened... and will not be easily contained.
                        
                        Meanwhile, in the corridors of the New Republic Senate, mistrust grows. The core worlds demand control, fearful that a new threat will emerge from the chaos. Some senators push for total militarization, while others seek diplomatic solutions, ignoring the signals coming from the fringes of space.

                        On a forgotten moon in the Drahgor system, an ancient cult has begun to gather in the shadows. Bearers of forbidden knowledge, their leaders claim to have heard the signal long before anyone else... and are preparing a ritual that could open doors that should never have been touched. Their followers speak of a “Herald of Rebirth,” a figure shrouded in darkness.
